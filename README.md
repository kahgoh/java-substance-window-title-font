Controlling the Window Title Font in the Substance Look and Feel
================================================================
Project demonstrating how the font of the Window title can be controlled when using the [Substance](http://insubstantial.posterous.com/) look and feel. The demo displays a single dialog with a drop down box for choosing the Substance skin and another for choosing the font of the Window title.

Project Notes
-------------
The code was written for Java 7 and is configured as an [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) project. It requires the following libraries:

* [MigLayout](http://www.miglayout.com) (I used version 3.7.4) 
* [Substance](http://insubstantial.posterous.com/) (I used version 7.0)

If wish to run the demo, the main class is `SubstanceWindowTitleFont`.
